<br>Volleyball taught me reflection, gave me team spirit, and brought me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of shouldering the reponsibility and scoring after a long round. Besides, I am a member of the Volleyball Team at Tsinghua University , where I meet many sincere friends.

<br>I previously enjoyed swimming, skiing, drawing and soft brush calligraphy. However, all of them are waiting for me to pick up at present. Pictures above are the painting I drawn when I was a kid.
